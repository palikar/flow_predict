	doi = {10.1126/science.1127647},

	abstract = {High-dimensional data can be converted to low-dimensional codes by training a multilayer neural network with a small central layer to reconstruct high-dimensional input vectors. Gradient descent can be used for fine-tuning the weights in such {\textquotedblleft}autoencoder{\textquotedblright} networks, but this works well only if the initial weights are close to a good solution. We describe an effective way of initializing the weights that allows deep autoencoder networks to learn low-dimensional codes that work much better than principal components analysis as a tool to reduce the dimensionality of data.},

  abstract = 	 {In this paper, we propose the Self-Attention Generative Adversarial Network (SAGAN) which allows attention-driven, long-range dependency modeling for image generation tasks. Traditional convolutional GANs generate high-resolution details as a function of only spatially local points in lower-resolution feature maps. In SAGAN, details can be generated using cues from all feature locations. Moreover, the discriminator can check that highly detailed features in distant portions of the image are consistent with each other. Furthermore, recent work has shown that generator conditioning affects GAN performance. Leveraging this insight, we apply spectral normalization to the GAN generator and find that this improves training dynamics. The proposed SAGAN performs better than prior work, boosting the best published Inception score from 36.8 to 52.52 and reducing Fréchet Inception distance from 27.62 to 18.65 on the challenging ImageNet dataset. Visualization of the attention layers shows that the generator leverages neighborhoods that correspond to object shapes rather than local regions of fixed shape.}

abstract="Contrast enhancement is used for many algorithms in computer vision. It is applied either explicitly, such as histogram equalization and tone-curve manipulation, or implicitly via methods that deal with degradation from physical phenomena such as haze, fog or underwater imaging. While contrast enhancement boosts the image appearance, it can unintentionally boost unsightly image artifacts, especially artifacts from JPEG compression. Most JPEG implementations optimize the compression in a scene-dependent manner such that low-contrast images exhibit few perceivable artifacts even for relatively high-compression factors. After contrast enhancement, however, these artifacts become significantly visible. Although there are numerous approaches targeting JPEG artifact reduction, these are generic in nature and are applied either as pre- or post-processing steps. When applied as pre-processing, existing methods tend to over smooth the image. When applied as post-processing, these are often ineffective at removing the boosted artifacts. To resolve this problem, we propose a framework that suppresses compression artifacts as an integral part of the contrast enhancement procedure. We show that this approach can produce compelling results superior to those obtained by existing JPEG artifacts removal methods for several types of contrast enhancement problems.",

Gradient descent can be used for fine-tuning the weights in such {\textquotedblleft}autoencoder{\textquotedblright} networks, but this works well only if the initial weights are close to a good solution. We describe an effective way of initializing the weights that allows deep autoencoder networks to learn low-dimensional codes that work much better than principal components analysis as a tool to reduce the dimensionality of data.},

  abstract = 	 {In this paper, we propose the Self-Attention Generative Adversarial Network (SAGAN) which allows attention-driven, long-range dependency modeling for image generation tasks. Traditional convolutional GANs generate high-resolution details as a function of only spatially local points in lower-resolution feature maps. In SAGAN, details can be generated using cues from all feature locations. Moreover, the discriminator can check that highly detailed features in distant portions of the image are consistent with each other. Furthermore, recent work has shown that generator conditioning affects GAN performance. Leveraging this insight, we apply spectral normalization to the GAN generator and find that this improves training dynamics. The proposed SAGAN performs better than prior work, boosting the best published Inception score from 36.8 to 52.52 and reducing Fréchet Inception distance from 27.62 to 18.65 on the challenging ImageNet dataset. Visualization of the attention layers shows that the generator leverages neighborhoods that correspond to object shapes rather than local regions of fixed shape.}

abstract="Contrast enhancement is used for many algorithms in computer vision. It is applied either explicitly, such as histogram equalization and tone-curve manipulation, or implicitly via methods that deal with degradation from physical phenomena such as haze, fog or underwater imaging. While contrast enhancement boosts the image appearance, it can unintentionally boost unsightly image artifacts, especially artifacts from JPEG compression. Most JPEG implementations optimize the compression in a scene-dependent manner such that low-contrast images exhibit few perceivable artifacts even for relatively high-compression factors. After contrast enhancement, however, these artifacts become significantly visible. Although there are numerous approaches targeting JPEG artifact reduction, these are generic in nature and are applied either as pre- or post-processing steps. When applied as pre-processing, existing methods tend to over smooth the image. When applied as post-processing, these are often ineffective at removing the boosted artifacts. To resolve this problem, we propose a framework that suppresses compression artifacts as an integral part of the contrast enhancement procedure. We show that this approach can produce compelling results superior to those obtained by existing JPEG artifacts removal methods for several types of contrast enhancement problems.",
